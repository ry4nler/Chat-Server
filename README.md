**General Reflections:**
Through completeing this task, I was able to understand node.js and socket.io better. I believe that through this task, I was able to be more hands-on on coding this task which allows me to understand the synatx of the libraries. While there are some possible extensions that I can do, for example having different colours for users, however, I believe that these extensions are more focused on css than networking. Since my goal of completeing this task is to gain a better understanding of multiplayer, and through this task, I have done so, I decided not to finish the extensions. I believe that this may be useful in my future tasks, where I may create a multiplayer game. Overall, this task has increased my understanding of node.js and socket.io.
